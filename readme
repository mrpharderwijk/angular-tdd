	This is just a sandbox to explore TDD
	with Mocha, Chai, Protractor, Selenium,
	Karma and Istanbul with a small contacts app.

	The environment is set up in Gulp. You can
	run it by typing:
	$ gulp serve

	It starts the environment on port 8080 and
	a simple backend express server on port 9001.
	
	The test evironment is available on port 8081.
	
	Refreshing after changes is done by browserSync.
